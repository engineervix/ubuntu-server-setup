Welcome to ubuntu-server-setup's documentation
***********************************************

.. note::

   `ubuntu-server-setup <https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup>`_
   is an opinionated `bash <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/>`_ setup script to automate the setup and
   provisioning of `Ubuntu <https://ubuntu.com/>`_  servers, **primarily biased towards
   python web applications** (`Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_,
   `Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/>`_, etc.).


.. admonition:: Why this documentation?
   :class: important

   This documentation was written to provide additional context and rationale
   behind the `engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup <https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup>`_
   project, which was forked from `jasonheecs/ubuntu-server-setup <https://github.com/jasonheecs/ubuntu-server-setup>`_.
   
   It is hoped that this will provide a useful reference not only for those
   who seek to use the setup script to bootstrap their Ubuntu server, but also
   for those that would like to fork the project and adapt it to their specific
   needs, just as I did. 
   
   Perhaps you like the project and would like to
   `contribute <https://github.com/engineervix/ubuntu-server-setup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_
   to its improvement -- this documentation will hopefully help you get a better
   understanding of what's going on "under the hood".

   Notwithstanding, I also wrote this documentation for my future self,
   because many times I forget the very code that I wrote, and even wonder
   why and how I wrote it!
